<p>Cats may not bark like dogs, but they have a complex system of communication involving vocal sounds, body language, scent marking, and facial expressions. Learning to interpret these signs is key to understanding a cat’s mood and needs.</p>

<p>Cats can produce over 100 different sounds, from soft meows and chirps to growls and yowls. Kittens meow to get their mother’s attention, and domesticated cats continue this behavior to interact with humans. Interestingly, adult cats rarely meow at each other—this is a language mostly reserved for people.

    Cats are territorial. They have scent glands on their cheeks, paws, and tail base. When a cat rubs against your leg or scratches furniture, they’re marking their territory with their scent. Spraying urine is another form of marking, though it’s more common in unneutered males.
